    Best Manga/Manhua/Manhwa to start with</h1>
<center><a href="sl.JPG"><image src="sl.JPG"></a></center>
     <pre style="font-size:20px"><center>
             First is let us differentiate Manga, Manhua, and Manhwa.
       Manga is a comic like book originated from Japan which is 
       normally written using traditional type of writting(hand made
       drawing).
       Manhua on the other hand, is like a Manga but most of
       all they all have similartopic, which is about 
       Cultivation/Daoism/Taoism,.Compared to Manga, Manhwa is less
       detailed and is usually written digitally.
       Lastly, Manhua. Manhwa is like Manhwa however the topics
       are not focused on cultivation but has more range of topics 
       like Fantasy and Romance which are the most popular.
       In conclusion Manga, Manhwa, Manhua has different characteristcs.

             Honestly speaking, starting of with manga is not a very
       good idea. For it discourages most readers to continue reading.
       It is because of the structure and details is too overwhelming.
    
              Manhua on the other hand has too much unfamiliar terms
       for those only starting. Like nascent soul realm, immortal
       assenscion realm,etc. which may discourage many readers. 

             The Best thing to start with is Manhwa, because it's
       always colored and updates faster compared to Manga( Manga posts
       new chapters once a month)
             
             Thus, starting with Manhwa is the best choice for it updates
       fast, colored, and has lesser unfamiliar terms compared to Manhua.
